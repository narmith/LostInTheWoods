I this barebones proyect we can find 3 types of attacks (via Mouse buttons: shoot arrows, throw rocks and punch things), move around, jump and kill some bad phantom guys.
Our "hero" is a girl who's being attacked by a pack of etereal zombies/ninjas.

Is either them or you, in a little medieval house you own somewhere on the woods.

Kill 3 of them or die trying.
Simple.


There are a little sound and light effects.
Also, don't expect much of the IA, it's just a proof of concept.

Feel free to copy any script you fancy over this repo.
