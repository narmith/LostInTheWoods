In this barebones proyect we can find 3 types of attacks (via Mouse buttons: shoot arrows, throw rocks and punch things), move around, jump and kill some bad phantom guys.
Our "hero" is a girl who's being chased around by a pack of etereal zombies/ninjas... not much of a plot but all is working as intended.

Is either them or her, in a little medieval house she owns somewhere on the woods.

She must defeat 3 of them to make them run for their money or die trying.
Simple right?

<br>

There are little sounds and lights effects.
Also, don't expect much of the AI, it's just a proof of concept.
Feel free to copy any script you fancy over this repo.

Update 18-Aug-2023
+ Made significant changes on props (new terrain, objects moved around and a lot of <del>pain</del> fixing).
+ Established a new Rendering Pipeline (URP) plus 2 packages for it.
+ Fixed materials along the change of the rendering pipeline (everything broke into bluish things).
+ Made a new custom Shader (Water FX), adapting some tutorials 5 years old over YouTube to my project in Unity 2022-03.

I still need to fix the rendering of the materials, but nothing mayor.
Everything looks better now!
