In this barebones proyect we can find 3 types of attacks (via Mouse buttons: shoot arrows, throw rocks and punch things), move around, jump and kill some bad phantom guys.
Our "hero" is a girl who's being chased around by a pack of etereal zombies/ninjas... not much of a plot but all is working as intended.

Is either them or her, in a little medieval house she owns somewhere on the woods.

She must defeat 3 of them to make them run for their money or die trying.
Simple right?


There are little sounds and lights effects.
Also, don't expect much of the AI, it's just a proof of concept.
Feel free to copy any script you fancy over this repo.
